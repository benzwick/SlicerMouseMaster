Mouse Profiles
==============

This reference documents all built-in mouse profiles supported by MouseMaster.
Each profile defines the available buttons, their Qt button codes, and default
action mappings.

.. note::

   This documentation is auto-generated from the mouse definition JSON files
   in ``MouseMaster/Resources/MouseDefinitions/``. Run
   ``test_generate_mouse_profiles.py`` to regenerate.
